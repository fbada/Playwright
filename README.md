# API and UI Automation Learning Path

## Overview
This repository serves as a learning path for mastering API and UI automation testing using Cucumber BDD and Playwright. The learning path covers a range of topics including API testing, BDD with Cucumber, UI automation with Playwright, and setting up Allure and Cucumber reports for test result visualization.

## Contents

1. **API Testing**
   - Understanding the fundamentals of API testing.
   - Writing API tests using JavaScript and libraries like Axios or SuperTest.
   - Validating API responses and handling different HTTP status codes.
  
2. **BDD with Cucumber-js**
   - Introduction to Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).
   - Writing feature files with Gherkin syntax to define test scenarios.
   - Implementing step definitions in JavaScript to execute test steps.
   - Integrating Cucumber with test runners for execution.

3. **UI Automation with Playwright**
   - Learning the basics of UI automation.
   - Setting up Playwright for browser automation.
   - Writing UI tests with Playwright for modern web applications.
   - Handling elements, forms, and interactions in UI tests.

4. **Setting up Allure Report**
   - Configuring Allure for test result reporting.
   - Integrating Allure with test frameworks for generating reports.
   - Visualizing test results with rich graphical representations.

5. **Setting up Cucumber Report**
   - Configuring Cucumber for test result reporting.
   - Generating detailed reports for Cucumber BDD tests.
   - Customizing report formats and styles for better visualization.

## Test Examples
The repository contains example tests that demonstrate the concepts covered in the learning path. These tests include:

- API tests for validating endpoints and responses.
- UI tests for automating interactions with web applications.
- BDD tests written using Cucumber to ensure behavior-driven development practices.
